# Follow Up Boss MCP Server — Built for Realtors

> Talk to your Follow Up Boss CRM in plain English from Claude AI (or any MCP-compatible tool). 160 tools covering 100% of the official API, plus `about`/`help` meta tools. Built by a working real estate broker, not a dev shop.

**Built by [Ed Neuhaus](https://neuhausre.com) — broker / owner at [Neuhaus Realty Group](https://neuhausre.com) in Austin, Texas.** Licensed real estate broker since 2009, 19+ years in the business. I built this because I wanted to talk to my own FUB account in plain English. It's free for self-host use under the [Elastic License 2.0](LICENSE).

### Other things I'm working on

- **[StaySTRA.com](https://staystra.com)** — Short-term rental investment analyzer
- **[mls.neuhausre.com](https://mls.neuhausre.com)** — MLS MCP server (live MLS data via Claude Desktop)

### Want to thank me?

1. **Got a real estate referral?** I take referrals from licensed agents in any state for clients moving to or from Texas. Reach out via **[neuhausre.com/contact](https://neuhausre.com/contact)**.
2. **Write about it.** Blog post, LinkedIn, X — tag me and link to neuhausre.com.
3. **Open an issue or PR** if you find a bug or build something useful.

> **WARNING: This tool has full read AND write access to your Follow Up Boss account.** It can create, update, and **delete** contacts, deals, tasks, notes, and other data in your CRM. **Strongly recommended: back up your FUB data before turning this loose, unless you really know what you're doing.** Always review AI-suggested actions before confirming changes to live data. The authors are not responsible for any data loss or unintended modifications to your FUB account.

> ### ⚠️ READ BEFORE SETTING `FUB_SYSTEM` / `FUB_SYSTEM_KEY` — TOS RISK
>
> Several FUB API endpoints are marked **"Restricted - Registered Systems Only"** and require `X-System` + `X-System-Key` headers (this MCP exposes them as `FUB_SYSTEM` + `FUB_SYSTEM_KEY` env vars). These endpoints include: **webhooks, inbox apps, automations (2.0), text-message logging, person/deal attachments.**
>
> **These credentials are issued by FUB to approved third-party integration partners — not to end users of FUB.** Setting these env vars is meant for developers who have registered a real third-party app with FUB and received their own dedicated `X-System` name and key.
>
> **DO NOT:**
> - Reuse `X-System` credentials from another app or integration you've found online.
> - Make up a system name and hope FUB accepts it.
> - Borrow a partner's credentials.
>
> **Doing any of the above to access restricted endpoints may violate Follow Up Boss's Terms of Service and could get your FUB account suspended or banned, with no notice.** FUB's rate-limit + identification policy is documented at https://docs.followupboss.com/reference#identification. To register your own system and receive a legitimate `X-System` name + key, follow FUB's guide: https://docs.followupboss.com/docs/start-here-brand-new-integration#registering-your-system-key.
>
> If you don't have your own legitimate registered-system credentials, **leave these env vars unset**. The MCP will throw a clear, actionable error on every restricted tool ("requires X-System + X-System-Key …") rather than silently bypassing the gate. The unrestricted 130+ tools all work fine on a regular FUB API key.
>
> **Use at your own risk. The authors of this project are not responsible for any TOS violations, account suspensions, bans, or data loss arising from your use of the restricted endpoints.**

> **License note:** This project moved from MIT to **[Elastic License 2.0](LICENSE)** in v1.1.2. You may use, modify, and self-host for your own business at no cost.

## What This Does

This server acts as a bridge between your Follow Up Boss account and AI tools like Claude. Once connected, you can talk to Claude in plain English and it will read, create, update, and manage your FUB data directly.

**What you can do:**

- **Contacts & People** -- Search contacts, create new leads, update stages, manage tags, check duplicates, view relationships
- **Deals & Pipeline** -- Create and manage deals, move them through pipeline stages, track values and closing dates
- **Tasks & Appointments** -- Create follow-up tasks, schedule appointments, set reminders, track outcomes
- **Communication** -- View call logs and text message history. Note: the API's "create text message" endpoint is log-only (FUB does not deliver SMS via the API); it is also a registered-system-only endpoint — see the warning above.
- **Email Templates** -- Create, edit, and merge email templates with contact data
- **Smart Lists & Action Plans** -- View smart lists, assign people to action plans and automations
- **Custom Fields** -- Create and manage custom fields for contacts and deals
- **Teams, Groups & Ponds** -- Manage team structure, round robin groups, and lead ponds
- **Webhooks** -- Set up and manage webhook integrations
- **And more** -- Inbox apps, reactions, threaded replies, email marketing campaigns, timeframes

## What You'll Need

1. **A Follow Up Boss account** with API access (most paid plans include this)
2. **Claude Desktop**, **Claude Code**, or any MCP-compatible AI tool
3. **Node.js 18 or higher** -- This is a free tool that runs JavaScript. If you don't have it, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (choose the LTS version)

## Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your FUB API Key

Your API key is like a password that lets this server talk to your FUB account.

1. Log into [Follow Up Boss](https://app.followupboss.com)
2. Go to **Admin** (top menu) > **API**
3. Copy your API key (it looks like a long string of letters and numbers)

### Step 2: Download & Install

**If you know git:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mindwear-capitian/followupboss-mcp-server.git
cd followupboss-mcp-server
npm install
```

**If you don't know git:**

1. Click the green **"Code"** button at the top of this page
2. Select **"Download ZIP"**
3. Unzip the downloaded file
4. Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
5. Navigate to the unzipped folder:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/followupboss-mcp-server
   ```
6. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Step 3: Run Setup

```bash
npm run setup
```

This will:
- Ask for your API key
- Test the connection to make sure it works
- **Ask you to choose Safe Mode or Full Access**
- Save your settings in a local `.env` file
- Show you exactly how to connect it to Claude

#### Safe Mode vs Full Access

| | Safe Mode (default) | Full Access |
|---|---|---|
| Read data (contacts, deals, etc.) | Yes | Yes |
| Create new records | Yes | Yes |
| Update existing records | Yes | Yes |
| **Delete records** | **No** | Yes |
| Tools available | 137 | 160 |

**Safe Mode is the default** and recommended for most users. It gives you everything except the ability to delete data. You can switch modes at any time by changing `FUB_SAFE_MODE` in your `.env` file or AI tool config.

### Quick Verify (Optional)

Before connecting to Claude, you can verify everything works:

```bash
npm test
```

You should see:

```
  PASS  Server starts and MCP handshake succeeds
  PASS  Lists 134 tools
  PASS  Read-only API call works (account: ok)

3 passed, 0 failed
```

If all 3 pass, you're good to go. If something fails, double-check your API key in the `.env` file.

### Step 4: Connect to Your AI Tool

Pick the tool you use below. Each one needs a small config file edit -- the setup wizard (`npm run setup`) will show you the exact paths and JSON for your computer, but here are the manual instructions for each.

> **What's a config file?** It's a settings file that tells your AI tool where to find this server. You'll copy/paste a small block of text into it. That's it.

---

#### Claude Desktop

1. Open Finder (Mac) or File Explorer (Windows)
2. Go to this file:
   - **Mac:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

#### ChatGPT, OpenAI API, and Grok

These tools only support **remote** MCP servers (hosted on the internet), not local ones. This means the setup is more advanced -- you would need to host this server on a cloud service with HTTPS.

If there's enough interest, we may add a hosted version in the future. For now, we recommend using one of the tools listed above that support local MCP servers.

## Usage Examples

Once connected, just talk to your AI tool normally. Here are some things you can ask:

> "Show me all my leads from this week"

> "Create a task to follow up with John Smith tomorrow at 2pm"

> "What deals do I have in my pipeline over $500k?"

> "Add a note to Jane Doe's profile: Had a great phone call, she's interested in the Oak Park listing"

> "List all my upcoming appointments for this week"

> "Who are my uncontacted leads?"

> "Move the Smith deal to the 'Under Contract' stage"

> "Show me all contacts tagged 'hot lead'"

> "Create a new email template called 'Open House Follow Up'"

> "What action plans do I have set up?"

Without valid registered-system credentials every tool below returns a `403` ("You do not have access to this API endpoint"); the MCP surfaces a clear "requires X-System + X-System-Key …" error before the call is made. To register and get your own system key, see FUB's guide: https://docs.followupboss.com/docs/start-here-brand-new-integration#registering-your-system-key.

</details>

## Rate Limiting

The server automatically retries requests when FUB's rate limits are hit (HTTP 429). It reads the `Retry-After` header and backs off with increasing delays, up to 3 retries per request. FUB's limits are:

- **Global:** 250 requests per 10 seconds
- **People updates:** 25 per 10 seconds
- **Notes:** 10 per 10 seconds

The `bulkUpdatePeople` tool also adds a built-in pause every 20 operations to stay under the PUT limit.

## Troubleshooting

**"Cannot connect" or "Connection refused"**
- Make sure Node.js is installed: run `node --version` in your terminal (should show v18 or higher)
- Make sure you ran `npm install` in the project folder
- Double-check the file path in your Claude config

**"Invalid API key" or "401 Unauthorized"**
- Re-check your API key in FUB: Admin > API
- Make sure there are no extra spaces when you copy/paste
- Run `npm run setup` again to test your key

**"Tool not found" in Claude**
- Restart Claude Desktop after adding the server config
- Check that the JSON in your config file is valid (no missing commas or brackets)

**Claude doesn't seem to know about FUB**
- Make sure the server name in your config matches exactly
- Check Claude Desktop's developer console for error messages
- Try asking Claude: "What MCP tools do you have available?"

## FAQ

**Is my data safe?**

Yes. This server runs entirely on your computer. Your API key stays in a local file on your machine and is never sent anywhere except directly to Follow Up Boss's official API. No data passes through any third-party servers.

**Does this cost anything?**

This server is free and open source. You just need a Follow Up Boss account with API access (included in most paid plans).

**Can Claude modify my FUB data?**

Yes, Claude can create, update, and delete records in your FUB account. Claude will typically confirm before making changes, especially for deletions. If you want read-only access, you can create a restricted API key in FUB.

**What's MCP?**

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard created by Anthropic that lets AI tools like Claude connect to external services. Think of it as a universal plug that lets Claude talk to your apps. [Learn more about MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).
